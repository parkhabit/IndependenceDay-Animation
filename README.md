# IndependenceDay-Animation
A short animation recreating the Independence day trailer

Using mainly css transitions, some animation, and set timeouts with JS.
Given limited time I decided to focus on getting the basics of the whole animation completed. I focused on making sure the elements moved in order and that a rough timeline was achieved.
If given more time many of the animations could have been more precise in terms of timing and movement. As it stands the animation is not set up to be cross-browser compatible, I would like to have included this with more time.
